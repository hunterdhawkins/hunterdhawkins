### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my github, where I store various personal and school repositories. Currently during my freetime where I am not programming, I am in the process of developing this readme along with cleaning up my respository structure.

- 🌱 At school I’m a graduate researcher focusing on the development of smart cities, intelligent industrial robots and the implementation and security of critical infastructure.

 - 🔭 At work I’m currently working with the Python Django web development framework to develop high level interfaces for low level critical infastructure systems. Some skills im learning include, web development, basic networking, and many other technical skills including power delivery/ protection and automation. These are being used accross the nation at Kootenai Water, Moteray One Water, Panelview RV park, Post Falls Wastewater and many others.
