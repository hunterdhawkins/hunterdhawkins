### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Some skills im learning include, web development, basic networking, and many other technical skills including power delivery/ protection and automation. These are being used accross the nation at Kootenai Water, Moteray One Water, Panelview RV park, Post Falls Wastewater and many others.
