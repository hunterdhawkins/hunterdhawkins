### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hunter Hawkins. I am a graduate student at the University of Idaho CDA, where I study intelligent industrial robotics and smart cities. I also am a control system integrator at wapiti consulting where my speciality is integrating low level PLC controls with high level python.
